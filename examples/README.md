# Examples of ELECTRE Tri-B

__Contents__

`base_profiles_pelectre.py`: Example of pELECTRE Tri-B (probabilistic ELECTRE Tri-B):
- 3 alternatives, 2 criteria
- 2 explicitely defined base profiles (for 3 categories).
    
The standard deviation of the values of performance matrix are in `S`.

`bldg_retrofit_base_pelectre.py`: Energy retrofit of a building with probabilistic values of performance marix. Find the membership of the three alternatives to the three catégories defined by base profiles.
> See: docs/tutorials/bldg_retrofit_base.ipynb

`bldg_retrofit_base.py`: Energy retrofit of a building. Sort three alternatives in three catégories defined by base profiles.
> See: docs/tutorials/bldg_retrofit_base.ipynb

`bldg_retrofit_level.py`: Energy retrofit of a building. Sort three alternatives in three equidistant categories obtained from extreme (i.e., worst and best) levels.
