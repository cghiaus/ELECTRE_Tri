    ['b', 'd'],

    ['e', 'f', 'h'],

    ] 


from Papathanasiou, J., Ploskas, N. (2018), Table A.1, page 167 8 criteria: {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} grouped in 4 subsets of ex aequo with white cards between placement of cards ('white' represents a white card).

    subsets_2 = [

    ] 
    
from Figueira, J., Roy, B. (2002) Table 1 page 319 12 criteria {A, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l} grouped in 6 subsets of ex aequo placement of cards ('white' represents a white card).

## function `criteria_weights_Simos`

```python
criteria_weights_Simos(set_cards_file: str, z: float)
```

Simos method for weights of criteria made by classification of cards. 



**Args:**
 
 - <b>`set_cards_file`</b> (str):  File (.csv) with the sets of cards (including white cards). Each row contains in a cell a string representing the criterion. A white card is represented by 'white'. 


 - <b>`z`</b> (float >= 1):  How many times the last criterion is more importnant than the first one. If there is only one rank, z = 1 (i.e. the last criterion is as importnant as the first criterion). 



**Returns:**
 
 - <b>`df`</b> (DataFrame):  2 columns: Criteria, Weight.
