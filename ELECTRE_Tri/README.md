ELECTRE Tri is a Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method for sorting alternatives into predefined categories. This repository contains a Python implementation of ELECTRE Tri, along with explanatory materials and example data.

## Repository contents

Python module:
- `ELECTRE_Tri.py`: core functions for implementing ELECTRE Tri method.

Jupyter notebooks:
- `ELECTRE_Tri_application.ipynb`: simple application wich requires only the performance matrix and criteria weights.
- `ELECTRE_Tri_explained.ipynb`: computational explanation of ELECTRE Tri method.
- `ELECTRE_Tri_yours.ipynb`: sandbox for your own ELECTRE Tri Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making.

Data folder:
- `data/`: Folder containing example datasets from literature for use with the Jupyter notebook.
