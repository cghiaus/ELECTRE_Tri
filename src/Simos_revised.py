    """Simos method for weights of criteria made by classification of cards.

    Args:
        set_cards_file (str): File (.csv) with the sets of cards
        (including white cards).
        Each row contains in a cell a string representing the criterion.
        A white card is represented by 'white'.

        z (float >= 1): How many times the last criterion is more importnant
        than the first one. If there is only one rank, z = 1
        (i.e. the last criterion is as importnant as the first criterion).

    Returns:
        df (DataFrame): 2 columns: Criteria, Weight.
