ELECTRE Tri is a Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method for sorting alternatives into predefined categories. This repository contains a Python implementation of ELECTRE Tri, along with explanatory materials and example data.

## Repository Contents

- `ELECTRE_Tri.py`: Python module containing the core functions for implementing ELECTRE Tri method.
- `ELECTRE_Tri_explained.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook providing a computational explanation of ELECTRE Tri method.
- `ELECTRE_Tri_yours.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for your own ELECTRE Tri Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making. Requires that you upload a `.csv` file describing the problem.
- `data/`: Folder containing example datasets from literature for use with the Jupyter notebook.
