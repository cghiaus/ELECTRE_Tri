ELECTRE Tri is a Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method for sorting alternatives into predefined categories. This repository contains a Python implementation of ELECTRE Tri, along with explanatory materials and example data.

## Repository Contents

- `ELECTRE_Tri.py`: Python module containing the core functions for implementing the ELECTRE Tri method.
- `ELECTRE_Tri.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook providing a computational explanation of the ELECTRE Tri method.
- `data/`: Folder containing example datasets from literature for use with the Jupyter notebook.

## ELECTRE_Tri.py

This module contains the main functions for implementing ELECTRE Tri. Each function is documented with docstrings, providing detailed information on usage, parameters, and return values.

## ELECTRE_Tri.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook serves as an interactive guide to understanding and applying the ELECTRE Tri method. It includes:

- Theoretical background of ELECTRE Tri
- Step-by-step implementation using the functions from `ELECTRE_Tri.py`
- Practical examples using the provided datasets

## Data

The `data/` folder contains datasets sourced from literature. These datasets can be used with the Jupyter notebook to replicate published results and verify the implementation's accuracy.
